# CENTAUR Estimation Specifications
# Language-agnostic specification definitions for statistical estimation
#
# Usage:
#   python src/pipeline.py run_estimation --specification baseline
#   python src/pipeline.py run_estimation --engine r --specification baseline
#
# Each specification defines:
#   - outcome: Dependent variable
#   - treatment: Main independent variable of interest
#   - controls: Additional control variables (optional)
#   - fixed_effects: Fixed effects to absorb (optional)
#   - cluster: Variable for clustered standard errors (optional)
#   - description: Human-readable description

baseline:
  outcome: outcome
  treatment: treatment
  controls: []
  fixed_effects:
    - unit_fe
    - time_fe
  cluster: id
  description: Baseline specification with unit and time fixed effects

no_fe:
  outcome: outcome
  treatment: treatment
  controls: []
  fixed_effects: []
  cluster: null
  description: Simple OLS without fixed effects

with_controls:
  outcome: outcome
  treatment: treatment
  controls:
    - covariate_1
    - covariate_2
    - covariate_3
  fixed_effects:
    - unit_fe
    - time_fe
  cluster: id
  description: Baseline with additional control variables

unit_fe_only:
  outcome: outcome
  treatment: treatment
  controls: []
  fixed_effects:
    - unit_fe
  cluster: id
  description: Unit fixed effects only (no time effects)

time_fe_only:
  outcome: outcome
  treatment: treatment
  controls: []
  fixed_effects:
    - time_fe
  cluster: id
  description: Time fixed effects only (no unit effects)

# Example of a more complex specification with interactions
# Uncomment and customize as needed:
#
# with_interactions:
#   outcome: outcome
#   treatment: treatment
#   controls:
#     - covariate_1
#     - covariate_2
#     - treatment:covariate_1  # Interaction term (R syntax)
#   fixed_effects:
#     - unit_fe
#     - time_fe
#   cluster: id
#   description: Baseline with treatment heterogeneity by covariate_1
